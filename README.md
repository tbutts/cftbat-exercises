# cftbat-exercises

I'm learning Clojure using [CFTBAT](https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/),
a delightful book about a fun, modern Lisp language for the JVM.

This repo contains my complete & partial solutions for exercises provided
at the end of most chapters.

## Running

Clojure files - `*.clj` - can be executed standalone with the
`clojure <path/to/file.clj>` command, or you can start the REPL using
`lein repl`, then within run `(-main)` for help!

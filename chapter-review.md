# Chapter Review Commentary Notes

Here lies a very brief summarization of each chapter from the CFTBAT book.

- [Chapter 1 - Building, Running, and the REPL](#chapter-1---building-running-and-the-repl)
- [Chapter 2 - How to Use Emacs, an Excellent Clojure Editor](#chapter-2---how-to-use-emacs-an-excellent-clojure-editor)
- [Chapter 3 - Do Things: A Clojure Crash Course](#chapter-3---do-things-a-clojure-crash-course)


## Chapter 1 - Building, Running, and the REPL

[Web link](https://www.braveclojure.com/getting-started/)

Introductions to dense topics are best left short, so as not to overwhelm the
reader. CftBaT does wonderful at introducing the oh-so-startling world of REPL-
driven development, a whole new build tool (`leiningen`), LISP syntax,
alternative languages hosted on the JVM, and Taylor Swift.

All of this fits in a slim dozen pages, as Higginbotham gently places the
specific subjects, such as how Clojure ties into the JVM, on the back burner.


## Chapter 2 - How to Use Emacs, an Excellent Clojure Editor

[Web link](https://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/)

This chapter covers Emacs, a separate entity altogether, following the minimum
steps to become a pleasant Clojure-smith, annealing s-expressions at a whim.
Although there are certainly more complete texts pertaining to Emacs, the
accompanying screenshots and keybinding tables, I feel, are unique to this
tutorial. Along with the writing style, it gives this chapter greater value
that what I imagine are much more dry introductions to Emacs.

Emacs turned out to be both one of the largest stumbling blocks, and sources of
enjoyment while learning Clojure. As a steady `vim` user for many years, the
fluidity of movement and text manipulation felt cleaner compared to `vim`-style
modal editing. Perhaps this is simply a coincidence of age & experience coming
together to make the learning process of such a complex tool a more brisk,
rewarding experience. I can safely say, however, that I will continue to adapt
Emacs into my workflow.
